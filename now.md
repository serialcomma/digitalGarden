## An Occasionally Updated Page of How I Occupy My Time

### Thinking about what's next

I'm a lawyer by trade, but I will soon retire from the formal world of work. I've had a great career, working for big companies and a boutique law firm on interesting and occasionally important projects. But it's time to do something different, so I'm spending a fair bit of time thinking about what I will do next. While I'm not in a hurry to decide, sitting around and doing nothing is not a long-term option. Stay tuned.

### Podcasts

When I was commuting every day, I had lots of time on public transport to listen to podcasts and rotated through 8-10 different series. Now that I'm working from home full time, I don't listen to podcasts as often. My current go-to podcasts, in order of listening time, are:

* *Stay Tuned with Preet* and *Cafe Insider*, both covering US legal issues in the news.
* *Revisionist History*, Malcolm Gladwell discussing an eclectic mix of obscure but interesting topics.
* *The Intercept*, a decidedly progressive view of current social, political, and legal issues in the US

### Music

Although rock music from 60s and 70s and new rock from the 90s are still my favorites, recently I've been listening to a lot of jazz on [KCSM](https://kcsm.org). Really excellent, no repeat jazz with blues and world music occasionally sprinkled in.

### Books

I used to read more broadly&mdash;Salman Rushdie, Edward Tufte, non-fiction in the history, politics, and science genres&mdash;but lately it's been spy and detective novels for entertainment: anything by John le Carr√©, the Bernie Gunther series by Philip Kerr, the Arkady Renko series by Martin Cruz Smith. I also greatly enjoyed the Cartel Trilogy by Donald Winslow.

That said, I'm currently working my way through *Say Her Name* by Dreda Say Mitchell and Ryan Carter. 

### Tech

Diving deeper on HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. Haven't dipped my toes in the Javascript waters yet but eventually I hope to.

### Other stuff

* Striving to support my wife and stepson as she supports him as he navigates a serious illness.

* Slowly making headway on planning our move from Singapore to Berlin and the US. Way too many moving parts.
