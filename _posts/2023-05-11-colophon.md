This site is based on Raghuveer S's [Simply Jekyll](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app) template. I have significantly changed the look and feel of his template while retaining (and in some cases enhancing) its functionality. I intend to continue refining the look and feel and adding meaningful functionality.

## Fonts

I prefer a serif font for body text and sans serif for headers and navigation elements. To match the Serial Comma blog, this site uses Lora and Sarabun, serif and sans serif Google fonts, respectively. The font for code is Jet Brains Mono.

## Font Sizes

The original template hard coded a large variety of font sizes in pixels. I have refactored all the font sizes in rems with a base size of 1.5rem (24px). Other font sizes scale up or down from the base size in ratios of a major third 2^(1/3) : 1, or about 1.26 : 1. The font sizes are then implemented in CSS variables.

See [Use Rems for Font Size to Respect User Preferences](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/use-rems-for-font-size/) for the reason to specify font sizes in rems and [Modular Scale](https://www.modularscale.com/) for the theory behind the font scaling approach. 

## Line Heights

For the main body text, I prefer large line heights to go with a large base font size. I chose a line height equal to 1.833 times the font size. It just looks right to me.
