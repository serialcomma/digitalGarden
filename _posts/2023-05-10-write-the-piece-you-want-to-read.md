The title of this note captures a notion I've had for some time. How often have I searched in vain for the answer to some (seemingly) simple problem? I either give up or eventually cobble together the answer myself. At that point I should write something to save others the same trouble. I've done it a few times&mdash;most notably an article on migrating from Evernote to Obsidian that I published on Medium&mdash;but not often enough.
