I have long been a fan of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/) and have tried to implement his ideas for communicating visually in my own works. His use of sidenotes instead of footnotes in written material appeals to me and I have been looking for a good implementation of them in a website. I think I have found a good template in Raghuveer S's [Simply Jekyll](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app) template, on which this site is based.

The best reference I have found to date on sidenotes is Gwern Branwen's [Sidenotes In Web Design](https://gwern.net/sidenote).
