title: An Implementation of Sidenotes
tags: siteDesign Jekyll

I have long been a fan of [[Edward Tufte::https://www.edwardtufte.com/]] and have tried to implement his ideas for communicating visually in my own works. His use of sidenotes instead of footnotes in written material appeals for me and I have been looking for a good implementation of them in a website. I think I have found a good template in Raghuveer S's [[Simply Jekyll::https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app]] template, on which this site is based.

The best reference I have found to date on sidenotes is Gwern Branwen's [[Sidenotes In Web Design::https://gwern.net/sidenote]].
