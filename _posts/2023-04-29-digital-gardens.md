I stumbled across the idea of a digital garden in the best "surf the web" sort of way. [Sidebar](https://sidebar.io) is one of my favorite sites for CSS, design, typography, color theory, and other interesting stuff that has nothing to do with my day job. I clicked on an article about [CSS blend modes](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/css/blend-modes?ref=sidebar), found the site itself to be as or more interesting than the content I came for, and after a few more clicks came to the author's explanation of his [digital garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/about). That resulted in some internet searches (I can't call it googling, because I use DuckDuckGo exclusively) that ultimately lead to [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), Maggie Appleton's brilliant essay that should be required reading for anyone interested in a new way to think about putting personal content on the web.

It was a relatively quick excursion down to the end of the digital garden rabbit hole (or the beginning, depending on how you look at it). I think it will be a considerably longer, and even more rewarding, journey back out.
